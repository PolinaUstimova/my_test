### Abstract
Botnet, a network of personal computers which are infected by harmful software, controlled without user intention which sends spam messages has its own behavior on the network during life time after infection and before the attack. Finding this pattern will give us this opportunity to find the infected devices before attack. Through analyzing a year old dataset of 10 attacks carried by 2 botnets we wish to provide the ability to recognize the infected devices before the attack starts. We are planning to implement this approach using neural network technique, clarification and clustering technique.
### 1. Introduction
#### 1.1 Context
Though the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) promises smart living for the inhabitants of this universe, the increase in the number of botnet attacks challenges their benefits. Botnets are malware-infected devices and mainly remain under the control of the hacker without the owner's knowledge. The compromised IoT devices acting as botnets are not only an attacker itself but also can spread infections among other internet-connected devices which is also categorized as aggressive action. However, In most cases, the infected devices never know about their contamination and they also participate in the propagation of such infections without having any intention.

#### 1.2 Objectives
The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset and predict infected devices as the early detection of botnets could allow us to isolate infected devices and take measures so that infections do not spread out.. In this project, we are going to propose a novel solution to detect IoT botnets and the mutated forms by analyzing IoT time series data with sem-supervised learning techniques and compare their performance. 

#### 1.3 Problem to Solve
The challenge is to reveal the botnet patterns and detect their mutated forms With the analysis of time series IoT data using Big Data Analytics techniques
