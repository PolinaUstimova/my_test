# Early IoT Botnet Detection Through Big Data Analytics
Though the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) promises smart living for the inhabitants of this universe, the increase in the number of botnet attacks challenges their benefits. Botnets are malware-infected devices and mainly remain under the control of the hacker. The compromised IoT devices acting as botnet are not only an attacker itself but also can spread infections among other internet-connected devices. In most cases, the infected devices never know about their contamination and they also participate in the propagation of such infections. Therefore, early detection of botnets could allow us to isolate infected devices and take measures so that infections do not spread out. With the analysis of time series IoT data using Big Data Analytics techniques, it is possible to reveal the botnet patterns and detect their mutated forms. In this project, we are going to propose a novel solution to detect IoT botnets and the mutated forms by analyzing IoT time series data with semi-supervised learning techniques and compare their performance.
